# LibraNetproject

LibraNet is a simple Object-Oriented Java application for managing a library.
It supports Books, Audiobooks, and E-Magazines, allowing users to:
->Add new items dynamically at runtime
->View all available items
->Borrow and return items
->Calculate fines for overdue returns

This project demonstrates OOP principles:

i)Abstraction (LibraryItem as an abstract class)
ii)Inheritance (Book, Audiobook, EMagazine)
iii)Polymorphism (displayDetails() behaves differently in each subclass)
iv)Encapsulation (private fields with controlled access)
v)Interface (Playable for Audiobooks)
